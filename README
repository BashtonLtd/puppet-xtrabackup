xtrabackup
----------

This is the xtrabackup module, to configure the wonderful Percona 
xtrabackup utility to make non-blocking backups


Usage
-----

You will need to specify credentials for a user with suitable credentials;
see 
http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtrabackup/innobackupex/privileges.html#permissions-and-privileges-needed
for further details

This module creates 'streaming' backups in the xbstream format, by default
compressed.  Before you can restore, **you must run prepare**.
A restore script, /usr/local/bin/mysql-backup-restore is provided which will
do this for you.

    class { "xtrabackup":
      dbuser    => "root",
      dbpass    => "rootdbpass",
      hour      => 3,
      minute    => 0,
      keepdays  => 14,
      workdir   => "/root/backupworkdir",
      outputdir => "/mnt/nfs/mysqlbackups",
    }

Please note that due to a bug in xtrabackup, your MySQL my.cnf **must** specify datadir.  If it doesn't,
you should add datadir = /var/lib/mysql to the [mysqld] section.
